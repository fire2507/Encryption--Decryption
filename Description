Encryption-Decryption Tool

This project is a simple yet powerful Encryption-Decryption Tool based on the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It allows users to securely encode and decode messages with a user-defined shift value. Ideal for beginners and enthusiasts in cryptography, this project demonstrates the basics of secure text transformation while preserving non-alphabetic characters. 

Features:
- User-friendly interface for encryption and decryption.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase alphabets.
- Retains non-alphabetic characters without alteration.

Tech Stack:
- Python: Core language for logic implementation.
